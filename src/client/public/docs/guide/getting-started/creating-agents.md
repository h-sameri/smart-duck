# Creating Your Trading Agent

## Step 1: Agent Setup

```
🎭 Create New Trading Agent

Choose a name for your agent:
```

**Agent Naming Tips:**
- Use descriptive names like "DeFi_Portfolio" or "Swing_Trader"
- Names must be unique to your account
- Alphanumeric characters and underscores only
- Maximum 20 characters

## Step 2: Agent Configuration

Once you create an agent, the system will:

1. **Generate Addresses**: Create unique blockchain addresses for your agent
2. **Deploy Escrow**: Set up a secure escrow contract
3. **Provide Details**: Give you funding instructions

## Agent Architecture

### What is a Trading Agent?

A trading agent is an isolated trading account that:
- Has its own blockchain addresses (escrow and actor)
- Maintains separate fund balances
- Can execute independent trading strategies
- Provides isolated risk management

### Multiple Agents Strategy

You can create multiple agents for different purposes:
- **Conservative Agent**: Low-risk, long-term positions
- **Aggressive Agent**: High-risk, short-term trades
- **DeFi Agent**: Focused on DeFi token opportunities
- **Stable Agent**: Balanced portfolio management
