# AI Analysis Engine

## Trading Decision Generation

The core AI analysis transforms market data into actionable trading recommendations using sophisticated prompting and structured output generation. This system serves as the primary decision-making component that evaluates cryptocurrency market conditions and provides specific trade instructions.

The engine processes historical price data, technical indicators, and market sentiment to generate comprehensive trading decisions with risk management parameters. It ensures consistency in recommendations by enforcing a standardized output format through Zod schemas.

```typescript
const TradeDecisionSchema = z.object({
  token: z.string(),
  sl: z.number(),           // Stop Loss
  tp: z.number(),           // Take Profit
  entry: z.number(),        // Entry Price
  currentPrice: z.number(),
  message: z.string(),
  confidence: z.number().min(0).max(100),
  tradeAmount: z.number().optional(),
});

async makeTradeDecision(
  ticker: string,
  priceHistory: PriceDataPoint[]
): Promise<TradeDecision> {
  const systemPrompt = this.buildTradingPrompt(ticker, priceHistory);
  
  const decision = await this.generateStructuredOutput(
    systemPrompt,
    `Analyze ${ticker} and provide trading recommendation`,
    TradeDecisionSchema
  );
  
  return decision;
}
```


### Advanced Analysis Features

#### Technical Indicators
The system employs a comprehensive suite of technical indicators to analyze price movements and market trends. These indicators provide quantitative signals that help identify potential entry and exit points, trend direction, and momentum changes.

The implemented indicators include:
- **SMA7**: 7-day Simple Moving Average for identifying short-term trends
- **Volatility**: Measures price fluctuations to assess risk levels
- **Momentum**: Detects the speed and strength of price movements
- **Support Level**: Identifies key price levels where buying pressure may increase
- **Resistance Level**: Identifies key price levels where selling pressure may increase

```typescript
calculateTechnicalIndicators(priceHistory: PriceDataPoint[]) {
  return {
    sma7: calculateSMA(priceHistory, 7),
    volatility: calculateVolatility(priceHistory),
    momentum: calculateMomentum(priceHistory),
    support: findSupportLevel(priceHistory),
    resistance: findResistanceLevel(priceHistory)
  };
}
```

#### Risk Assessment
The risk assessment module evaluates potential trading opportunities by analyzing multiple risk factors to provide a comprehensive risk profile. This process helps traders make informed decisions by quantifying the risks associated with each trade recommendation.

Key risk factors evaluated include:
- **Volatility**: Measures price fluctuations and market uncertainty
- **Liquidity**: Assesses how easily a token can be bought or sold without affecting its price
- **Correlation**: Analyzes relationships between different tokens to understand portfolio risk
- **Market Sentiment**: Evaluates overall market mood and trader psychology

```typescript
async assessRisk(decision: TradeDecision): Promise<RiskMetrics> {
  const riskFactors = {
    volatility: this.calculateVolatility(decision.token),
    liquidity: this.assessLiquidity(decision.token),
    correlation: this.calculateCorrelation(decision.token),
    marketSentiment: this.analyzeSentiment()
  };
  
  return this.generateRiskScore(riskFactors);
}
```

## Generic Advice System

For queries without specific tickers, the system provides market-wide analysis and general trading guidance. This functionality serves as a comprehensive market overview tool that helps traders understand broader market conditions and identify potential opportunities across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.

The generic advice system aggregates data from multiple tokens and market indicators to provide holistic insights. It's particularly useful for traders who want to understand overall market sentiment, identify trending sectors, or get general guidance without specifying individual assets.

```typescript
const GenericAdviceSchema = z.object({
  marketOverview: z.string(),
  topRecommendations: z.array(z.string()),
  riskFactors: z.array(z.string()),
  marketSentiment: z.enum(["bullish", "bearish", "neutral"]),
  advice: z.string(),
});

async provideGenericAdvice(
  prompt: string,
  cachedData: any,
  marketSummary: any
): Promise<GenericAdvice> {
  const systemPrompt = `You are an expert cryptocurrency analyst providing market overview.
  
  Current market data:
  - ${marketSummary.cachedTokens} tokens analyzed
  - Market trends: ${this.analyzeMarketTrends(cachedData)}
  
  Provide comprehensive market analysis including:
  - Overall market sentiment
  - Top trading opportunities
  - Risk factors to consider
  - General trading advice`;
  
  return await this.generateStructuredOutput(
    systemPrompt,
    prompt,
    GenericAdviceSchema
  );
}
```
